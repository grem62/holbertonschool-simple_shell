## Description :newspaper:

The shell is a program that receives computer commands given by a user from his keyboard and sends them to the operating system, which will then execute them.

In the early days of computing, the shell was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays and with the arrival of the mouse, all computers use graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as macOS or Windows 10, in addition to command line interfaces (CLI) such as the shell.

## Compilator :space_invader:

~~~c
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
~~~

***
## Testing :arrow_forward:

The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

~~~c
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
~~~
# command simple shell:

pwd:

cd:

ls:

echo:
